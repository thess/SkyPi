SkyPi
=====

Sky map for Raspbery Pi and 4D Systems uLCD-43PT display.

A collection of sky mapping and display routines combined to show planets and bright stars as viewed from a specific geographic location (latitude & longitude) on earth.

This application was originally inspired by an article in Nuts & Volts magazine entitled "Steampunk Planetarium Clock". My version uses the Raspberry Pi platform as the main engine and a 4D Systems uLCD-43PT touch-screen display attached to the serial port for graphics and user interaction.

A lot of credit goes to the following organizations, projects and people from whom I've borrowed ideas and code for this project:

+ Geoffery Gill - Steampunk Planetarium Clock, Nuts & Volts, Nov. 2012 (Original project idea plus sample code)

+ John Walker - [Home Planet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/homeplanet). Selected routines to calculate sun, moon and planet positions. Nice application on its own.

+ [4D Systems](http://www.4dsystems.com.au) - Excellent products, development tools and support.

+ [Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://raspberrypi.org) Hard float (armhf) version of Rasbian (Debian Wheezy).

Additional documentation on the various components, build and installation procedures can be found in the INSTALL file in this package.
