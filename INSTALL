Build and installation instructions for SkyPi
=============================================

It is possible to build and execute SkyPi on any Linux system, such as Ubuntu,
with the display connected via a serial USB adapter.

Minimal prereqs: build-essential, cmake

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make


[default installation]
    $ sudo make install

[manual installation]
- Copy SkyPi to /usr/local/bin & make executable
- Copy data/hyg11.csv to /usr/local/lib/SkyPi/starmap.csv


Prepare micro SD card for display (FAT16, 2GB Max)
==================================================

1. Using 4D Workshop (Windows or Wine on Linux)
   - Compile rtcset.4dg
   - Compile clockrd.4dg

2. Copy to SD card:
   - rtcset.4XE
   - clockrd.4FN
   - keypad/keypad.dat, keypad/keypad.gci
   - lcddigits/digits.dat, lcddigits/digits.gci
   - data/cuckoo.wav


Set SPE default to 115200 on display
====================================

The default baud rate of the LCD is 9600. SkyPi will indeed operate at this
speed though things will a bit slow. I recommend changing the default baud
rate to 115200 using 4D Workshop. This is accomplished by:

1. Seclect Options, Serial and set the baud rate to 115200
2. Re-load SPE via Serial project, Tools, SPE load.

When the display powers up is should now say "Comms 115200".


Command-line options
====================

RaspPi Realtime Sky Map V0.95

SkyPi [options] [device]

 device    Comms port to which display is attached (default: /dev/ttyAMA0)
 options:
   -f file     Path name of starmap DB (default: /usr/local/lib/SkyPi/starmap.csv)
   -l lat,long Observer decimal latitude & logitude
   -q          Disable cuckoo chimes
   -s speed    Serial device baudrate (default: 9600)
   -t          Use system time instead of LCD clock
   -w hh:mm    Display wake time (default: 06:30)
   -z hh:mm    Display sleep time (default: 23:30)
   -B          Run in background (daemonize)


SkyPi setup and operation
=========================

The RPi system date-time and timezone information needs to be set. Timezone information
may be setup by invoking 'raspi-config' or 'dpkg-reconfigure tzdata'. If you have a
DS1307 connected to the LCD, date-time can be set thru the initial startup display on
the LCD. Otherwise, specifiy the '-t' command-line option to bypass the set-time screen
and to use the current system time however it was set (NTP, GPS, etc).

If you have a DS1307 RTC (Adafruit, Sparkfun, or equiv) connected to the LCD, you can
thne use the built-in time and date setup panel and keypad to set the time and date.
Note: The time and date must be set to UTC (24hr clock).

Each press of the 'Time' button will select a time field to be changed via the number
keys. After setting the seconds field, press the 'Set' button to write to the RTC and
start the clock.

Each press of the 'Date' button will select a date filed to be changed via the number
keys. The date field form is: mm:dd:yy. After setting the year field, press the 'Set'
button to write the date to the RTC.

Press the 'exit' button to exit setup and startup the sky map display.

Pressing the display while the star map is displayed will reset the serial port and
re-start setup if not deslected by '-t'. Otherwise, just restart the star map.

Pressing the display while it is sleeping will re-enable the display. The display will
go back to sleep after 30 minutes.

The (optional) cuckoo will chime the hours (12hr clock) and once on each half-hour. It
may be disable via the '-q' option. Feel free to replace the cuckoo.wav file on the
LCD's SD card with you favorite noises.

Autostart on boot may be accomplished by adding a simple command-line entry at theend
of '/etc/rc.local'. Example:

    # Launch SkyPi (sleep at 10:30pm)
    /usr/local/bin/SkyPi -B -s 115200 -l 18.433551,-64.633290 -z 22:30
